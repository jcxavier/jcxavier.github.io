So this is the beginning of this blog. It has been pretty much almost 2 months since I've moved to Berlin.
Everything's been working great so far, living here is just like I had expected if not better.

I wanted to give a fresh take at a blog for two reasons. I have had quite some articles which I've been writing to write about IT in general, or just some ramblings about different topics. By far, this is the most appropriate place to address that, as Twitter's 140 characters are seldom enough.
The second one is I was inspired to share impressions about living in Germany and in Berlin. In this way I'm enabling people to "follow me" and get to know a little bit more how I'm spending my days and what do I deal with on a day-to-day basis.

Two of my friends who are out there in their adventures have started one and inspired me for doing the same. Actually I would recommend checking them out! Here's [Filipe's website](filipearaujoribeiro.com), who's on a career break, and [André's London blog](http://andre-nascimento.com/london/).

I've also provided an option to subscribe for weekly updates, which you can find back at the [main page](www.jcxavier.com).

##### St. Oberholz

Why is this post named like this? If you were really curious up to this point, you probably already looked it up. It is a café / restaurant in Rosenthaler Platz, really close to where I live, where the 2.0 version of my website started and where I first set up this blog.
I moved to my current place a few weeks ago and didn't have a decent Internet connection back then, and St. Oberholz was my safe haven for browsing and hacking.
They also serve mean cups of coffee and pieces of cake! I found that there have been some IT-related events held there before, such as hackathons.

So, enough for a quick intro. If you are nearby, be sure to stop there, it's worth it. It's open every day until midnight and on Fridays and Saturdays until 2 AM! You can also have your regular beer there.
