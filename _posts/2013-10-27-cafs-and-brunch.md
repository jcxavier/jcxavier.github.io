On a nice Sunday evening (well, not so nice as it could be sunnier, but still, warm), what better to talk about from Berlin than the cafés and the brunch culture, while writing this post in a Thai café/bar?

It may or not be a nice coincidence that most shops and groceries are closed on this day of the week here. The truth is, by taking a stroll in Berlin you can quickly find places open, with very inviting looks and you can almost taste the food by just feeling its scent. It should be also no coincidence that these places get really crowded and sometimes it might be hard to find a place to stay.

Brunches are quite popular, and there are a lot of cafés that serve them for quite some hours (some until almost evening), for every taste. It could be russian, french, swiss, german, portuguese. You name it, you should be able to find it. This is really international, after all.

Prenzlauer Berg seems to be a nice place to go for a brunch. One of the places currently in my to-go list is [Café Anna Blume](www.cafe-anna-blume.de). If you get a chance to grab one while you're here on a Sunday, it is really worth it!
